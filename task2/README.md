# Maze
From reading the assignment to full realization spent approximately 3 hours.  
Recursive Backtracker is chosen as the algorithm to implement the maze https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm

## Build and Run for Linux
Start console from project directory and enter the commands
``` Bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Maze
```

# Complexity
Time Complexity: $O(height * width)$  
Space Complexity: $O(height * width)$ - memory for stack
